All IRPF90 requestors MUST agree to the following license agreement which
covers all versions of IRPF90 (source code and binaries).

With regard to the IRP Fortran90 preprocessor IRPF90, together with its
associated utility programs, with which you have supplied me a
copy, I agree to the following conditions:

   1. I will not supply a copy of the code to anyone outside my institution or
corporation for any reason whatsoever. Instead, I will refer any requests for
copies of the program to Anthony Scemama at CNRS. This in no way limits my making of
copies of the code for backup purposes, or for running on more than one
computer system at my institution or home.

   2. I understand that copyright or ownership rights to IRPF90 are retained by
Anthony Scemama and CNRS to the IRPF90 package. I will not incorporate any part
of IRPF90 into any other program system, either for sale or for non-profit
distribution, without written permission from Anthony Scemama and CNRS,

   3. I understand that no large program such as IRPF90 can be considered to be
bug free, and accordingly Anthony Scemama and the CNRS supplies the IRPF90 software on an "as is"
basis, with no additional responsibility or liability,

   4. This license is considered a "Research Group" license. Thus anyone
directly associated with your research group is covered by the license and may
share your copy of IRPF90 on all of your group's computer resources.
